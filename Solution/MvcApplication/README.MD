This is a generic pluggable package, developer can use this package to authenticate and authorize dynamically every requests comes to web application.

	Developer can have role based authorization dynamically. There's no need to hard code any Role Name. This package has own UI interface to authorize any role against any permission at any time.

Encrypted token will be saved in cookie. Internally this package holds user's state during MVC request life cycle. So developer doesn't need to worry about state management of login user.

	Each & Every token will be generated by use of unique secrete key to encrypt user's information. In other world, If I would say, the secrete key will not be same for each successful login, whether it is same or different user, so consequently  each and every encrypted token will be unique too. 

Once user is authenticated by username and password, this package will help you to create an encrypted token which will come with each request so that request will be authenticated and authorized.

	This package is not forcing you to implement any specific membership provider, Even developer can have your own custom implementation to authenticate username and password.
